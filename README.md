### ZODIO

### Explore music tracks closely associated with people of the same zodiac sign as yourself.

### App Name Origination
The name Zodio derives from the words "zodiac" and "radio". 

### Use Case
It is an iOS app that allows its users to search and discover the tracks people of the same zodiac signs are listening to.

### IDE
This app was built using Xcode 8, Swift 3 and requires atleast iOS 10.2 to run.

### External Technologies
Third party technologies used are SoundCloud Public Search API for providing the app's data, CocoaPods as the dependency manager for external libraries, and Alamofire for making the Network request to the api.

### How To Use The App
Use the `Zodio.xcworkspace` file to open the app in Xcode

Set the active scheme to `Zodio`. This is located in the top left corner in Xcode to the right of the `Stop` button.

Choose the simulator device of your choice in Xcode or connect a physical device.

`Tap inside the textField` to activate the editing mode and enter your zodiac sign.

Use the `return` key on the hardware or software keyboard to search.

Explore a list of tracks to choose from.

Listen to a track with the options to `Start` and `Stop` it.

Then discover other tracks from the user of the current track.

### Future Features

A recommendation system based on the tracks being search by a certain zodiac sign using storage.

Allow users to choose their zodiac signs rather than typing/spelling it out into a textField
